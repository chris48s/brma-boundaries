# Boundaries for Broad Rental Market Areas

## What is it?

Broad Rental Market Areas (BRMAs) are the geographical areas used to determine Local Housing Allowance (LHA) rates. They are maintained by the [Valuation Office Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/valuation-office-agency). This repository makes the boundaries of these areas available in GeoJSON and KML formats facilitating easy use with popular web-based mapping libraries and APIs. These GeoJSON/KML boundaries are derived from converting ESRI shape file boundaries published at:

* http://www.sharegeo.ac.uk/handle/10672/603
* http://www.sharegeo.ac.uk/handle/10672/605
* http://www.sharegeo.ac.uk/handle/10672/608

This data was obtained in September 2014 (England and Wales Boundaries) / October 2014 (Scotland Boundaries). Thanks to Owen Boswarva for obtaining this information and making it available via [ShareGeo](http://www.sharegeo.ac.uk/).


## Usage

Download the boundaries and use them in your project or app. Most popular web-based mapping libraries and APIs support either KML or GeoJSON formats. e.g:

* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)
* [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/)
* [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/)

GitHub also features some support for directly embedding GeoJSON from repositories. See: https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/
